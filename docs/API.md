1. __stateman.current__: 
	the current state in state manager, if a navigating is still in pending, the current represent the destination state. 

2. __stateman.previous__: 
	the previous state in state manager
	
3. __stateman.pending__: 
	the pending state in state manager, point the state that still in pending.

imagine that you navigating form state named 'contact.detail' to the state named 'user.detail', the current is point to contact.detail and the previous will point to 'user.detail'.
